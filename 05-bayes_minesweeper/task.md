Your goal is to write an AI player for the well-known game [MineSweeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)). If you are not familiar with this game, you can try it [here](https://minesweeperonline.com/).

File minesweeper_player.py contains a trivial player and your task is to improve it. Note that you cannot win all games. You can modify this file as you like but keep the interface used by file minesweeper_test.py. Only the file minesweeper_player.py is expected to be submitted.

You can use and combine every knowledge from our course, i.e. informed search, logic and probabilistic reasoning. Especially, CSP or SAT solvers can be usefull. However, you are expected to explain you approach, so write comments in your code. Teachers will reduce the number points for unclear code.

File probability_test.py contains tests to verify the correctness of calculating the probability of a mine on each cell. These tests are evaluated by 0 points on recodex, so their passing is voluntary. Nevertheless, they may be helpful to fulfill this assignment.
