# IntroAI

Homework for the course Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

## Requirements:

* You can obtain at least 10 points for each assignment
* The threshold for passing is 7×number of assignments
* Deadline: usually 2 weeks (except state holidays, the 1st assignment, etc.)
* Submit on [recodex](https://recodex.mff.cuni.cz)

## Programming assignments:

* You are given a partial implementation of an AI task on [git](https://gitlab.mff.cuni.cz/finkj1am/introai)
* Implement the missing bits
* Automatic checking, tests are public (the same as on Recodex)
* Instructor looks at the source code and evaluate its source codes
* Programming language: Python

## Experimental assignments:

* Measure properties of a given implementation
* Write a report (and submit PDF)

## General rules

* Feel free to talk about assignments with other people, but do not share code nor reports (except with the instructor).
* Deadlines are strict.
* Before deadline, you can re-submit.
* The number of points depends on tests you pass.
* Quality of your code and reports contributes to grading.
* Do not use code you didn't write yourself.
* Your program must work on every input. Although tests are available, it is forbidden to precompute any results for these tests.
* You can use only [the standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) and libraries listed in [requirements.txt](https://gitlab.mff.cuni.cz/finkj1am/introai/-/blob/master/requirements.txt).
* Cite all sources you used to fulfill given tasks.
* Missing citations and plagiarism will be reported to [Disciplinary Board](https://www.mff.cuni.cz/en/faculty/organizational-structure/department?code=4).
